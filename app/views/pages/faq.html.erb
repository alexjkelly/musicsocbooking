			<dt>What's MusicSoc?</dt>
			<dd>MusicSoc is the music society at the University of Bath. Unfortunately you can only join if you're a student at the university, but most of our socials are open for anyone to attend. If you want to keep up to date, please join our <%= link_to "Facebook group", "http://www.facebook.com/groups/130934812093/" %>. However, you are unable to use our band practice room. We recommend <%= link_to "Stage 2 Studios", "http://www.stage2studios.co.uk/" %> as an alternative. If you are a student at the University of Bath, head on over to our page on <%= link_to "BathStudent", "http://www.bathstudent.com/socs/societies/musicsoc/" %> and join up today for the bargain price of Â£3!</dd>
